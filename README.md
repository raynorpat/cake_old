# Cake

## Overview

Cake is a modified glquakeworld based on the source code released by id Software. Cake is a unified QuakeWorld engine, meaning both client and server exist under one executable. Not only is it unified, but it also has support for playing singleplayer games and watching normal quake demos.

I plan on using Cake as a basis for building first and third person games for myself and hopefully others will fork the engine and use it for their own needs.

I am not finished working on Cake, so bug reports are very much welcome. 

## Downloads

Preview releases of _Cake_ for all platforms are not quite available just yet.

## Compiling

Cake builds with premake. If you've never tried it, please do so, it rocks.

## Installing

To have a working game, you must install the game data. All that is required is id1/pak0.pak from the Quake shareware release or both pak0.pak and pak1.pak from the registered version.
