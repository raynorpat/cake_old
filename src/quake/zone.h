memory allocation

================================================================

The hunk manages the entire memory block given to quake.  It must be
contiguous.  Memory can be allocated from either the low or high end in a
stack fashion.  The only way memory is released is by resetting one of the
pointers.

Cache memory is for objects that can be dynamically loaded and
can usefully stay persistent between levels.  The size of the cache
fluctuates from level to level.
